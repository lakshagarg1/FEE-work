        Michael Dell founded Dell Computer Corporation, doing business as PC's Limited in<br>1984 while a student at the University of Texas at Austin,[14] operating from Michael<br>Dell's off-campus dormitory room at Dobie Center.[15] The start-up aimed to sell IBM PC<br>compatible computers built from stock components. Michael Dell started trading in the<br>
        belief that, by selling personal computer systems directly to customers, PC's Limited<br>could better understand customers' needs and provide the most effective computing<br>solutions to meet those needs.[16] Dell dropped out of college upon completion of his<br>freshman year at the University of Texas in order to focus full-time on his fledgling<br>business, after getting about $1,000 in expansion-capital from his family.[17] As of April<br>2021, Dell's net worth was estimated to be over $50 billion (equivalent to<br>$55,470,000,000 in 2023).[18]
